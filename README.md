# Collatz Conjecture
A simple math problem that we can't still solve !
<p>This repository contains a python based program which return the number of iterations and the producted number as a list for a input value , however this function does not work for value 0 and will result in memory error </p>

<h2>A breif explaination of Collatz Conjecture</h2>
<p>Our question here is Does all the positive integer will eventually reduced to 1 or not? <br>So, here is what Collatz Conjecture (3x+1 conjecture) is 
Take any positive integer say '3' as 3 is an odd number we have to do 3x+1 that is 3*3+1 which is '10' <br>
Now '10' is an even number so do the integer division 10/2 = 5 <br>
'5' is an odd so do 3*5+1 ='16'<br>
It goes on until it reaches 1  by the time we reach one it will be forming an infinite loop by iterating over 1->4<br>
</p>
<h2>What this program about ?</h2>
<p>This program consist of a function which will return the numbers till 1 for an input value </p>

<h2>Coming functions </h2>
<p>Tree formation </p><br>
<p>Graph generation from the list of values </p><br>
<p>And something else too</p>
